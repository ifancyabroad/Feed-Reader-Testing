## Feed Reader Testing
## About
### Description
This is a project for learning the **Jasmine** framework for testing in _JavaScript_. Several tests are run on the app to ensure everything is functioning as it should.

### Origins
The code was written as part of the _Udacity_ Front-End Nanodegree course. It was created from the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git) which contains code for the blog and the first test suite.

### Process
Some the **challenges** faced while developing the application are as follows:
- Implementing the Jasmine framework into JavaScript
- Testing asynchronous functions
- Error handling

## Installation
To view and run the code simply clone/download this repository and to run the app simply open **index.html** in your preferred browser. Code for testing can be found in the **feedreader.js** file.
